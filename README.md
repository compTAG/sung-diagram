# Sung Diagram

This is the project repository for the sung diagram project.

## Getting setup

Congrats on getting the project cloned.
The project is set up using submodules and is in the following folders:

- app: Troy's application code, located in his github repo
- doc: website code, located in this repo
- paper: paper's latex source, located on overleaf.

Once you have cloned the repo "install" the submodules with the following
commands:

    git submodule init
    git submodule update

Now you have all the content and are ready to roll!
