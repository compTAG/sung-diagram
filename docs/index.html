subtitle: Revitalizing the Eisenhower Matrix
---

The Eisenhower Decision Matrix, credited to the task management system of US
President Dwight Eisenhower, is a graphical diagram used in strategy and
planning for tasks.  This matrix, however, only provides four types of
priorities.  We identify a collection of scenarios in which the traditional
matrix provides misleading suggestions and propose an extension to the matrix
that addresses the misleading suggestions illustrated with examples and
implementation in a web application.
